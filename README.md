Modules for BMC Patrol developed to solve a need for monitoring UNIX and Linux servers.

They are by no mean in a form or shape that follows offical developer guidelines from BMC, as they

* Do not have recoverable actions
* Do not have help pages
* Do not have nice and fancy patrol icons

On the other hand, they are

* Free (under GPL V3)
* Tested to catch critical events over quite some years.

If you need help in adding features send a mail to zensonic@zensonic.dk and we can figure out what that will cost you.
